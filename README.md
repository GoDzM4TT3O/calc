Here are a few examples:

| 1 - 1   | Subtraction    | Returns 0 |
| 2 * 2   | Multiplication | Returns 4 |
| 4 / 2   | Division       | Returns 2 |

| 4 % 2   | Modulus        | Returns 0 |

## Why was this written?

This was written because I was tired of using the slow Python as a command-line calculator.

I wanted something fast, that I could modify whenever I wanted to.

So, I quickly started writing the barebones of the calculator. It's nothing fancy, really, but a nice tool to have.

More features might be added, if necessary.
